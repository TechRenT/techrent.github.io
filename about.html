        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>I worked as an IT staff before for almost seven years, and I gained experiences on how to troubleshoot computer problems, repair printers, setup and maintain computer network and other IT related stuffs. In 2011, I decided to work full-time as an Upwork contractor. Since then, with over 13,000 hours of work on Upwork, I have gained additional skills and experiences.

With the knowledge and skills that I have acquired from my previous and present job experiences, I am confident enough that I can provide excellent service to my clients. The feedback and recommendations of my previous employers will serve as proofs of my hard work and dedication to work. I always give my 100% to every project. My ultimate goal is not only to make money, but also to satisfy my clients by providing them the best service and excellent result that will go beyond their expectations.</p>
